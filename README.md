# task-board

A kanban board to add/delete tasks in organized swim lanes;

When clicking on the "Add Task" button, the user is prompted to enter task information, due date, and description of task, and then "Add Task" in order to create a task card for a swim lane.

The task cards are color coded (red, yellow, or green) based on how close the due date is to the deadline.

There is an option to delete a task card, which erases the card from the board completely.
